Title:  Lmod and XALT: What's New with TACC's Environment Module
System and How XALT can track what your users are doing?

Lmod is a modern Environment Module system.  We will briefly discuss the
features of Lmod over other module systems.  Also we  will cover the new ways that Lmod
will allow for hiding modules without removing them as well as better
ways to handle dependent modules and other new features.

XALT is a extremely lightweight solution to track what your users do.
The new XALT tracks both MPI and non-MPI programs.  Come see how easy
it is to better understand what your users are doing.  Let's learn how
to drink from the firehose of job data that your site is generating.
