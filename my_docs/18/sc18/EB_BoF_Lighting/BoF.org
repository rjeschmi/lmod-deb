Here are some ideas for BoF talk on Lmod and XALT?

* Talk about Lmod?

What can I say about Lmod in 5 mins or less?  Stickers?

Lmod: A flexible Env. Module System that reads TCL and Lua based
modules.  No translation required.  Lmod does it for you.  
Lmod reads Cray modules.  We do it at TACC!

** Ideas:
*** Reads TCL and Lua modulefiles
*** Support Software Hierarchy (not required!!)
*** Spider Cache: Fast loads, avail, spider
*** Collections: users can have their own default modules
*** Site tayloring: Hooks, Many Configuration Options
*** Hidden Modules
*** Optional Tracking of Module Usage
*** Used around the world.  (show readthedocs usage?)
*** Many more feature: See lmod.readthedocs.io

* Talk about XALT?

I am more interested in my XALT work than Lmod.  I solved the scalar
execution problem.  Now work inside Singularity containers. It
optionally tracks GPU usage.

** Ideas:
*** Tracks both MPI and Non-MPI (Scalar) programs
*** Tracks run time and library usage
*** Extremely light weight
*** Not a performance measuring tool
*** Uses LD_PRELOAD trick to track 
*** Site tayloring
*** Optionally Track Package use in R, MATLAB, Python
*** Use to know resources by Node-Hours, How Frequent, Most Users.
*** Learn more at: xalt.readthedocs.io
