Here are some ideas for the Lmod Booth Talk

* 7th annual Booth talk on Lmod.
* Last year:
** NVV support
** hidden
** ~/.modulerc support
   
* This year:
** depends_on()
** Reference Counting: The /usr/local/bin problem
** Tracing output (module -T load foo)
** CMAKE shell added
** module --show_hidden avail with "dim" output and (H) prop.
** Lmod_test_suite
** French, German and Spanish translations for Lmod messages
** A marked default is honored even if it is hidden.
** Admin list (AKA Nag.list) supports Lua regular expressions for matching Modules to nag about.

* Future Work:

** module export <collection>.  it may be a separate command.
** Changing the behavior of Ref Counting for MODULEPATH.
