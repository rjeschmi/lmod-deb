Title:  Environment Modules: Tmod, Cmod, Lmod oh my!

Environment Modules are the keys to how we provide software for our
users on our large systems. Versions of this tool have been around
since the '90s. The first problem is to chose one. Yet this is only
the beginning on how to set up your system.  There are many different
architecture choices: Flat vs. Hierarchical, Local vs. Share disk
location, Naming Conventions, Internal Module Conventions, Package
Lifetime questions and how do sites deal with a broken bash shell
startup with MPI among many others.

Other questions include how to transition from an old module layout to
a new layout.  Can a new tool help solve some of the issues you are
having at your site?  This BoF is a chance to bring together different
sites to see how they handle the above issues and more.  Let's come
together and bitch about modules!
