Here are some ideas for my talk to the EB User group.

* They already know about Lmod

* History of Lmod (5, 6, 7)

* Topics:
** Nag message
** Depends_on()
** Hidden modules
** Dynamic Cache files for external module trees

* Tons of features
* Focus on 4

* Nag Message
* depends_on()
* Hidden Modules
* Dynamic cache files.

   This will require a change to Lmod but it is mostly there.
   Just need to turn off the auto scanning of new MODULEPATH's
